# price_comparison_tool

This project is the first project done for my [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://github.com/databuzzer/100-days-of-code).

This tool will provide insight in the current pricing of several products I personally purchase quite often to make me understand the price development and when to purchase
these items for the lowest price.

Fases in the creation of this project:  
1. Build web scrapers for 10 web stores for like 20-30 products.
2. Bring the data together in a database.
3. Present the data in a web application, preferable build in Django.
